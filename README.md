# Azure OpenAI GPT-4o Mini TTS Demo

A demo project for experimenting with the Azure OpenAI GPT-4o Mini TTS (Text-to-Speech) API. Includes a Gradio-powered soundboard UI and sample scripts for generating speech from text using a variety of voices and vibes.

## Features

- Interactive Gradio soundboard to try different voices and vibes
- Sample scripts for streaming and saving TTS audio
- Easily configurable for your Azure OpenAI resource

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- An Azure OpenAI resource created in `eastus2` with GPT-4o Mini TTS model deployed as a Global Standard deployment type

### Deploy GPT-4o Mini TTS Model with Azure AI Foundry
Quickly deploy the GPT-4o Mini TTS model:
1. Sign in to the [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/).
2. Navigate to **Catalog**, filter by **Azure OpenAI**, and select `gpt-4o-mini-tts`.
3. Click **Deploy**, choose or create your resource, and enter a deployment name.

Click **Deploy** again to finalize.

For detailed instructions, see the [full deployment guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/deploy-models-openai).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-openai-tts-demo.git
   cd azure-openai-tts-demo
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Configuration

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your Azure OpenAI endpoint and API key:
   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your values
   ```
   Example:
   ```env
   AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="https://<your-resource-name>.openai.azure.com/"
   AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="your-azure-openai-api-key"
   AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION="2025-03-01-preview"
   ```

## Running the Demo

### Gradio Soundboard UI

To launch the interactive soundboard:

```sh
python soundboard.py
```

- Select a voice and vibe, then click Play to generate and listen to speech.

### Sample Scripts

- `streaming-tts-to-file-sample.py`: Streams TTS audio to a file.
- `async-streaming-tts-sample.py`: Streams and plays TTS audio asynchronously.

Run a sample script with:
```sh
python streaming-tts-to-file-sample.py
```
